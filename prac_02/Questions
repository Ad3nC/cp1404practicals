Line 1 produced a random number between 5 and 20
The smallest being 5 and the largest being 20
Line 2 produced a random number between 3 and 10
the smallest being 3 and largest being 10
A 4 could not be produced by line two because the third parameter the 2 makes it so that each random instance is odd
Line 3 produced a random number between 2.5 and 5.5
The smallest being 2.5 and the largest being 5.5
